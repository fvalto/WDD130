                        It is a collaborative treatment established in the relationship between a person and the therapist, using dialogue as its 
                        basis to generate a support space that allows them to speak openly with someone objective, neutral, and impartial who helps them 
                        generate solutions to their conflicts. Simply put, you and the psychologist will work together to identify and change the patterns of 
                        thought and behavior that keep you from feeling good.

                        Many times, when we go to a psychologist, we think that it is similar to going to the doctor, one goes, in one or two 
                        sessions, the doctor identifies what he has and prescribes something similar to the cure. However, psychotherapy is a 
                        little more complex than that, it goes through several states during the different sessions, but broadly speaking, the 
                        first sessions are diagnostic, which is a process where the therapist knows the person and finds out why he is going to 
                        therapy, he knows about his life, his family, his history, basically a puzzle of the other is put together in the mind, 
                        this diagnostic process can end with an accurate verdict as some pathology or simply with different diagnostic hypotheses. 
                        Then, they mutually agree on what aspects to work on and how they plan to address it, to finally move on to what is known 
                        as a closing process, where the consultant is expected to be able to be independent and manage to identify patterns that 
                        are harmful to themselves and can face these challenges from a different perspective autonomously.

                        Talking with a therapist about our problems is different from talking with other trusted people because talking with third parties is generally 
                        a cathartic process where unconditional empathy is sought from the other, where it is expected that the third party is always willing to help 
                        us. feel better, this is much more noticeable when it happens with friendship ties since the objective of talking with third parties is not the 
                        healing of the psychic condition but rather the cathartic process generated with a third party. On the other hand, psychotherapy has rules and 
                        an established structure, where the psychotherapist has a neutral role in the face of the exposed conflicts, he does not seek to deliver the 
                        answers to the user, but rather he manages to develop themselves. Also, when recommending actions, they are based on the scientific study of 
                        human behavior and not on their own experience.

                        The vision of psychotherapy, especially on the part of people who have not attended any session in their life, is that people come with 
                        conflicts and the role of the psychotherapist is to solve the problems of others. This vision could not be more wrong, first of all, because 
                        for psychotherapy, the first step, even before touching the treatment room, is to be able to identify for oneself that something is wrong 
                        and they have to solve it, so the role of the psychotherapist is not only to give guidance but rather to get the same person to question 
                        himself, and help him solve conflicts, maintaining a co-helper role in this process of improving things, showing the person different ways 
                        from seeing the situations for the other by yourself, get to know how to improve in a unique way to your own needs and way of being.

                        The fundamental pillar to attending psychotherapy is to want to resolve your own conflicts, this is crucial because, in the process of self-discovery, 
                        many things flourish that must be faced, in this process we realize things that we do not like or that we must change of ourselves, the process 
                        of personal healing implies in some cases pain but also discovery, and a natural healing of the things that at some point damaged us and led 
                        us to be what we are today.
