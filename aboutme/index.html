    <h2>Fabián Valdés</h2>
    <p>I'm from Chile, I have been almost three years married now to my wife, Claudia. I work as an auto parts salesman at a Chevrolet/Toyota dealership. I like computers and working with them, I like to spend time with my wife, play video games, listening music, and rock climbing.</p>
    <p>I recently finished PathwayConnect, and now I'm on my way to getting a certificate in web and computer programming, after serving as a ward clerk for almost 2 years, I rediscover my passion for computers and helping people by giving IT support and solutions, so I decided to study programming, I really like it. I'm still uncertain of which branch of programming to follow, but I'm sure I will be able to find it during the process.</p>
    <p>Thanks for taking a look at my page and reading a little about me, I'm looking forward to learn along with you guys!</p>
